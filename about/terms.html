<h2 style="line-height: 28px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Welcome to GAMEFSTOREML!</h2>
<p>
Thanks for using our products and services (“Services”). Please read these Terms of Service ("Agreement" or “Terms”) carefully before using GAMEFSTOREML Marketplace, GAMEFSTOREML Studios, GAMEFSTOREML’s websites, mobile apps, games, products, and any related services (collectively with GAMEFSTOREML Marketplace and GAMEFSTOREML Studios, the “Services”) offered by IJJI, INC. (doing business as "GAMEFSTOREML").
</p>

<p>
This is a legally binding agreement, and you should read it carefully.  By installing, using, or otherwise accessing our Services, you (the "user" or "you") agree to be bound by this Agreement, including those additional terms and conditions and policies referenced herein and/or available by hyperlink. This Agreement applies to all users of the Services, including without limitation users who are vendors, customers, merchants, or contributors of content, information and other materials or services.
</p>

<h2 style="line-height: 32px; margin-bottom: 20px;">1. Use of Services</h2>
<h3 style="line-height: 28px; margin-bottom: 15px; font-weight:400">GAMEFSTOREML Marketplace</h3>
<p>
GAMEFSTOREML Marketplace, or “Marketplace”, acts as a venue to allow users who comply with GAMEFSTOREML's policies to offer, sell and buy certain goods. GAMEFSTOREML is not directly involved in the transaction between buyers and sellers. As a result, GAMEFSTOREML has no control over the quality, safety, morality or legality of any aspect of the items listed, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of sellers to sell items or the ability of buyers to pay for items. GAMEFSTOREML does not pre-screen users (except for services that require an application) or the content or information provided by users. GAMEFSTOREML cannot ensure that a buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction. 
</p>
<p>
Consequently, GAMEFSTOREML does not transfer legal ownership of items from the seller to the buyer. GAMEFSTOREML cannot guarantee the true identity, age, and nationality of a user. GAMEFSTOREML encourages you to communicate directly with potential transaction partners through the tools available on the App. 
</p>
<p>
You agree that GAMEFSTOREML Marketplace is a venue and as such GAMEFSTOREML is not responsible or liable for any content, for example, data, text, information, usernames, graphics, images, photographs, profiles, audio, video, items, and links posted by you, other users, or outside parties on GAMEFSTOREML Marketplace. You use GAMEFSTOREML Marketplace at your own risk.
</p>

<h3 style="line-height: 28px; margin-bottom: 15px; font-weight:400">GAMEFSTOREML Studios</h3>
<p>
GAMEFSTOREML Studios, or “Studios”, provides access to games, including online games, browser games, mobile games, social media games, and any other digital offers of games or interactive entertainment for any end devices (e.g., PCs, smartphones, tablets, connected devices such as streaming or set-top boxes and smart TVs) and/or online platforms (e.g., social networks), developed and/or published by GAMEFSTOREML through GAMEFSTOREML Studios' webpages or services provided by third-parties, such as app stores and social networks for games (the "Games").

You shall not, under any circumstances, access or attempt to access the source code of any of the Games.
</p>
<p>
You understand that, for reasons that include, without limitation, system security and stability, the Games may require automatic updates, pre-loads, creation of new versions or other enhancements and, accordingly, the system requirements to use or access the Games may change over time. These Terms do not entitle you to future updates, new versions or other enhancements, although GAMEFSTOREML may choose to provide such updates, new versions or other enhancements in its sole discretion.
